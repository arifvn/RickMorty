# RickMorty
## RickMorty catalog app implementing current Android Architecture MVVM Pattern 

In this app I used RxJava instead of Courotine. I also used NetworkBoundResource from Github-App-Sample and tweak it a bit to adapt with RxJava and make it more "kotlin" way. Feel free to use it and hit the start button if you like.
